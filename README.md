# Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) Insights Collector

## üìò Overview
This PowerShell script (`Get-AVD-Insights-Extended.ps1`) automates the collection and export of **Azure Virtual Desktop Insights** metrics from a Log Analytics Workspace.

It retrieves detailed telemetry defined in Microsoft‚Äôs [AVD Insights Glossary](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/insights-glossary), including:
- **Time to Connect** (overall and component breakdowns)
- **Connection success rate & daily trends**
- **User Input Delay (median/p95)**
- **RTT (Round Trip Time)** by Gateway Region
- **Estimated Bandwidth (kBps)** by Gateway Region
- **CPU and Memory utilization** per session host and environment-wide
- (Optional) **Process I/O performance** from your own CSV (e.g., disk and I/O metrics)

All collected data is saved into a single **Excel workbook**, with an optional **PDF export** for easy sharing and review.

## üéØ Purpose
Azure Virtual Desktop offers rich telemetry via Log Analytics, but querying and correlating the data manually can be time-consuming and inconsistent.

This script provides:
- A **repeatable, automated baseline** for performance, latency, and user experience analysis.
- A **comprehensive snapshot** of AVD health across hosts, users, and gateway regions.
- **Faster troubleshooting** by surfacing key metrics (RTT, logon time, CPU, memory, input delay) in one place.
- A **developer-friendly foundation** for building your own dashboards or automation pipelines.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Dev/Non-Production Use Only
> üö® **This script must only be run in development or test environments.**
>
> - It uses diagnostic queries that can generate large volumes of data.
> - It performs real-time analytics against your Log Analytics workspace and may incur query costs.
> - It is designed for **engineering validation, baselining, or lab testing** ‚Äî **not** for production automation or scheduled monitoring.
> - Always validate in a sandboxed environment before considering any adaptation for production.

## üß© Value
- **Consolidation:** Combines metrics from multiple KQL tables (`WVDConnections`, `WVDCheckpoints`, `Perf`, `WVDConnectionNetworkData`) into a single export.
- **Transparency:** Maps directly to the metrics Microsoft defines in the official AVD Insights documentation.
- **Flexibility:** Supports optional inclusion of your own per-process I/O metrics.
- **Ease of analysis:** Data is written to structured Excel worksheets ‚Äî perfect for filtering, graphing, and trend analysis.

üß† Understanding the Data
All queries and metric definitions map directly to Microsoft‚Äôs Azure Virtual Desktop Insights Glossary.
Key sources include:

WVDConnections, WVDCheckpoints ‚Äî for connection stages and time-to-connect metrics

WVDConnectionNetworkData ‚Äî for RTT and bandwidth by gateway region

Perf ‚Äî for CPU, memory, and input delay counters

User Input Delay per Process ‚Äî for user experience metrics

üß∞ Example Use Cases
Benchmarking login and session performance during golden image updates.

Comparing RTT across gateway regions to diagnose connectivity variance.

Analyzing CPU/memory saturation trends across session hosts.

Correlating disk I/O performance from your CSV to session delays.

Producing an on-demand AVD performance baseline for internal reviews.
